
Welcome to the RADAR-API documentation!
========================================


The **RADAR-API** is a Python package designed to make your life easier, whether you aim to download some weather radar data, search for specific files, or jump into scientific analysis.
Our goal is to empower you to focus more on what you can discover and create with the data, rather than getting bogged down by the process of searching and handling it.

The map here below displays the radars currently accessible through RADAR-API.

 all while making your workflow smoother, enjoyable, and more productive.
